The main files are CONV-MNIST.py which is the convolutional neural network implementation and HDR-MNIST.py which is the HDR tree implementation

both files can be ran with a "demo" flag which will enable to user to draw digits and then make inferences on them.

with the demo flag on the HDR tree after drawing it will also retrieve the mean vector and the first element of the terminal node and draw them as well for visualization
